## Three.js Cube - My First 3D Object

### Description

This project is my first experiment with Three.js, where I created a simple rotating 3D cube using basic scene setup, camera positioning, and rendering techniques. It helped me understand the fundamentals of Three.js, including how to set up a 3D environment and animate objects.

### Features

• Created a 3D scene using Three.js

• Added a cube with basic material

• Rotated the cube over time to make it dynamic

• Rendered the scene using WebGLRenderer

### Learning Experience

While working on this, I learned:

1. How to import and set up Three.js in a project

2. The importance of scene, camera, and renderer in a 3D environment

3. How to create a geometry (cube) and apply a material to it

4. Basic animation using requestAnimationFrame

### Installation & Usage

#### Clone this repository:

1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-cube.git

2. Open index.html in a browser.

3. The 3D cube should be visible and rotating.

### Future Improvements

• Adding lights to make the cube look more realistic

• Experimenting with textures

• Enhancing interactivity

### Resources

• Three.js Official Documentation

• Three.js Examples
